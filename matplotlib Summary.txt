There are by far the most rides in the cities and the most drivers, but the average fare is higher in the rural areas

Highest percent of total fares, total rides, and total drivers are in the urban areas

Clearly the urban areas are the best place for a person to catch a rider.  Also, a driver who wants to make a lot of money and can commit the time to picking up a lot of riders is best served by working in the city.  But someone who doesn't want to drive a lot can make the best money in the rural areas, where the average fares are higher
